                        but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest. At
                        around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed.He was rushed to the

                        aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: <em>"Funny guy! Are you doing well?"</em></li>
